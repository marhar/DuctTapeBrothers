        <h1>The Duct Tape Brothers</h1>
<h2>Getting ready for Globals!</h2>
<p>Sunday, May 21, 2006</p>
<p><img alt="" src="150935069_950b9a6481.jpg" /></p>
<p>So the brothers had their final meeting and practice session. We
received a briefing on what to expect at Globals, and got their
pins. If we can get Internet connectivity while we are there we
will be using this blog to report daily on our happenings.</p>
<p>Can we upload photos here? lets see!</p>
<h2>Arrived at DI!</h2>
<p>6:13am, Wednesday, May 24, 2006</p>
<p><img alt="" src="152654717_07c15e3f5c.jpg" /></p>
<p>We've arrived!</p>
<p>The flight was good, no delays and smooth flying the entire way.
We arrived at Nashville with some confusion as to what the time was
(answer: Nashville is on Central time, Knoxville on Eastern).</p>
<p>We got the SUV, and were just able to fit everyone and everything
inside.</p>
<p>We drove off about 5:30, stopping to eat at a Pizza place. We stopped
once on the way, at a place that featured "Icees, all sizes,
69cents!!" This was compared quite favorably to Bonfaire's prices,
and the cultural advantages of rural Tennessee was briefly discussed.</p>
<p>We arrive at about 10:30 local time (I think), and checked in to
the dorms at about 11:30 or so. Alex and Brian are sharing a room,
and Forrest and Olaf are sharing another.</p>
<p>We had a late night quick briefing, and after unpacking and washing
up were in bed by 1:00am.</p>
<h2>Rise and Shine, Ye People of West Coast Time!</h2>
<p>1:20pm, Wednesday, May 24, 2006</p>
<p><img alt="" src="152652736_54f4dd0a02.jpg" /></p>
<p>Breakfast is served 7:00-9:00, which translates to 4:00-6:00 our
time. Alex and Brian went down first. Joy of joys, they had biscuits
with gravy, but neither boy seemed to appreciate that fact. Oh Well.</p>
<p>We saw Olaf and Forrest on the way out, everyone is downstairs
trading pins. We've met international teams from Poland, Singapore,
and Guatemala, and US team from all over.</p>
<p>I managed to get online, but wow does dialup seem slow.</p>
<p>Plans for today: inspect all the props we shipped, figure out how
to make a new hat box and Duct Tape Brothers sign. The afternoon
will be a session for the boys on how to do instant challenges. The
opening ceremony is tonight at 7:00.</p>
<h2>We receive but fail to appreciate some expert Instant Challenge training</h2>
<p>8:24pm, Wednesday, May 24, 2006</p>
<p><img alt="" src="152652168_acd3e37693.jpg" /></p>
<p>We had to hurry lunch, in order to get to the special Instant
Challenge workshop. One of the lunch pavillions had ready-made
sandwiches to go, so that worked out perfectly. We ate on the way,
walking and taking a shuttlebus.</p>
<p>The workshop was from 12-5:30, so that kept the boys occupied while
Buffy went to a team managers' meeting. I took care of a few
outstanding items and we picked them up from the workshop. They
were pretty tired coming out. It seems they thought the training
wasn't particularly special, which was generally attributed to the
excellent job Buffy has been doing so far.</p>
<p>On the way back we found a cardboard box sitting next to a construction
site that we salvaged to rebuild the hat stand. It was about 2'x2'
and about 7 feet long. The bus driver very kindly let us bring it
back!</p>
<h2>The Brothers are Reunited</h2>
<p>8:53pm, Wednesday, May 24, 2006</p>
<p><img alt="" src="152807802_c9b95fa749.jpg" /></p>
<p>We rushed back from the workshop in order to have dinner as soon
as possible. Partly because we wanted to have plenty of time to get
to the opening ceremonies at 7:00, but mostly because we were all
really hungry. Everybody was a bit grumpy but generally well behaved.
The training they've been going through together is really paying
off.</p>
<p>While we were at dinner, we received work that Eric and Michael had
arrived! Everybody was happy with the news because we feared that
we might not be able to hook up with them prior to the opening
ceremony. We celebrated with a picture.</p>
<h2>The Opening Ceremonies are well received</h2>
<p>9:21pm, Wednesday, May 24, 2006
Once we were reunited, we walked to the coliseum for the opening
ceremonies. There was a buzz in the air, and the Brothers were not
immune. Buffy brought some flashy blinky toys, as is apparently the
tradition for the opening ceremonies.</p>
<p>There were over 6,000 participants plus parents, managers, etc. It
was truly an awesome experience, and when they introduced the teams
from the various states and countries, the rafters shook with the
cheers.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="152806334_c9bf8fce5e.jpg" /></p>
<p>The foreign teams were given an especially rousing welcome. China,
Singapore, several European and South/Central American countries
all fielded teams.</p>
<p>There were the requisite speeches, which cooled everyone down but
were generally well received. Finally it was time for the final
parts of the ceremony. They played a medley of the National Anthems
of all the participating countries. It was a surprisingly emotional
tribute, and everyone in the arena was visibly moved.</p>
<p>Finally, the big finish arrived. There was an excellent music and
light show filled with lasers and pyrotechnics.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="152805774_5943ea1e34.jpg" /></p>
<p>Everyone was totally taken with the performance. The Brothers, who
had previously seen only the regional and state slideshows, were
awestruck. It was truly an evening they will remember for the rest
of their lives. The only thing needed to make it a perfect day was
a bit of late-night pin trading.</p>
<h2>More photos available</h2>
<p>6:15am, May 25, 2006
I'm not uploading all the photos I'm taking coz of the slow dialup
line, but there's a few more than have been posted here (sad
blogger.com story).</p>
<p>I've put these on my flickr account with their own "di" tag. You
can view them <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/marhar/tags/di/">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Rainy Morning Antics</h2>
<p>6:15am, Thursday, May 25, 2006
So the alarm went off at 7:30am local time, which translates to
about 4:30am our time. The boys were up with a reasonable amount
of vim and vigor. This was surprising given that we had all been
awakened at about 4:30 by the dumpster truck banging the dumpsters
around like some kind of anvil chorus.</p>
<p>If you're in line for breakfast before 8:00, it's basically a matter
of walking in and being served. But if you're just a few minutes
later than 8:00, the line goes down the stairs, down the hall, and
out into the courtyard.</p>
<p>So our plan was to go and eat, and bring back some muffins and
coffee for Buffy and Granny, who were busy taking care of Skye.
This would also give them a bit more time to sleep in. That sounded
like a good plan to Forrest and Olaf, who decided to join the
sleeping-in crew.</p>
<p>It was raining a bit, but we caught a break in the weather and ran
over to the cafeteria, threading our way through the early morning
pin traders (much to the chagrin of Eric, who is showing all the
early signs of Pin Mania Syndrome). Breakfast was good... Eggs,
bacon, and waffles (the poor boys just don't seem to understand the
logic behind putting gravy on perfectly good biscuits!).</p>
<p>We very tidily packed up enough muffins for everyone, and a couple
of cartons of milk. However, we did not anticipate the exit door
guy. In addition to making sure people didn't sneak in the exit,
he's supposed to make sure large quantities of food doesn't sneak
out the exit as well. In this case, "large quantities" seems to
pretty much mean "any quantity." We explained the situtation to
him, and he said we could each carry a muffin out, as if we were
finishing it up, along with either a cup of coffee or a carton of
milk (if it was opened... again, as if we were finishing it up).</p>
<p>So, we quickly redeployed the rations, and walked out the door and
down the stairs, only to find ourselves in the middle of a huge
storm, lightning and thunder and all. We took a few moments to
discuss why storms over dry land generated more electrical activity
than storms generated over water, and exactly how we were going to
get back to the dorm without getting totally soaked. It seemed our
best bet to head for the tent area where the pin traders where still
hard at it. We waited a bit for a break in the weather but running
out of patience declared by fiat that the weather had broken. Eric
took the lead in dashing across the commons, with everyone else in
tow. We had considered putting all the muffins in Eric's hat to
keep them dry, but came to the conclusion that people would probably
rather eat muffins that were a bit damp rather than muffins that
had been stored in somebody's hat.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="153434716_788ce6e16d.jpg" /></p>
<p>We survived the dash and have changed in to dry clothes, and are
now in our homework hour, working on the various school assignments
we brought with us.</p>
<p>Later we will work on rebuilding the props we broke down for shipment
and rebuilding the things we didn't ship. One of the lunch pavillions
is serving BBQ, featuring pulled pork sandwiches. The boys are eager
to try this delicacy so we'll take the shuttle bus over that way,
weather permitting.</p>
<h2>In Praise of Pulled Pork</h2>
<p>5:18am, Thursday, May 25, 2006</p>
<p><img alt="" src="153775021_4c0514dfcf.jpg" /></p>
<p>Lunch was a great success. Everyone enjoyed the much-discussed
pulled pork sandwich, along with coleslaw, potato salad, and BBQ
beans. Following up with an ice-cream sandwich, everyone agreed,
was a splendid idea.</p>
<p>After lunch, we went to the pin trading area away from our dorm.
This was important, because we're placed into the dorms by state,
so the California pins we had were in high supply and low demand
at the nearby trading area.</p>
<p>We met people from quite a few states and countries, and the "pin
theory" of introduction proved to be quite accurate. We greeted and
were greeted by many people with the simple phrase, "Where are you
from? Any interesting pins you've traded for?"</p>
<p>We met the Chinese team, who was trading lots of miscellaneous
Bejing 2008 pins -- not quite genuine DI pins, but plenty close for
most people. Also hot on the trading list were the Colorado and
Poland pins, as well as the Maryland crabs and Massachusetts ducks.
Texas was in a pin league of their own, with many individual team
pins as well as numerous state and region pins.</p>
<h2>Getting Serious</h2>
<p>9:08pm, Thursday, May 25, 2006</p>
<p>I hope that the posts so far haven't given the impression that the
boys have been focused exclusively on eating and pin trading. They've
been doing quite a bit of work preparing for their presentation
times.</p>
<p>They had to unpack all of the stuff which had been shipped, and see
if it was still in working order. It was, fortunately, including
the hat and the barrel noise-maker. (I had to go down with Buffy
to fetch the stuff from the shipping dock... it was heavy, the
biggest package being over 50 lbs. Buffy gets another checkmark on
her sainthood scorecard for packing that up and carrying it to the
post office!)</p>
<p><img alt="" src="153433804_a5fc36d556.jpg" /></p>
<p>In addition, they created a new Duct Tape Brothers sign, and made
a new hat stand. Everyone was very delighted with the new work and
agreed that it was an improvement on the previous pieces. I think
they were pleased that they were able to take a potential setback
(not having some of their props shipped) and, with very limited
time (a day) and supplies (a box scrounged from a construction site)
and turn it around into something which actually improved their
project.</p>
<p>They did a runthrough in the hall before going to dinner. Everyone
was a bit tired and hungry, so there was a reasonable share of
frazzled nerves and short tempers, but overall it was a successful
walk-through. The practice session was right in front of the elevator,
so they would periodically get a surprised-looking audience every
few minutes.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="153434478_c9d9b3b38c.jpg" /></p>
<p>Earlier in the day (on the way home from pin trading) we stopped
off to watch a few competitors and see what the stage looked like.
There's a picture of Tom Hanks there when he performed on the very
stage, which made a bit of an impression on everybody.</p>
<p>We had a pretty tough reminder that the Globals are a serious
competition. The second team we watched ran over their 8-minute
allotment, and the appraisers called time. The lights went up, and
the team had to stop in mid-presentation. In the regionals, they
let the teams wrap up their act, but the Globals are on a tight
schedule, and the competitors are expected to understand and conform
to all the rules.</p>
<h2>A note on the weather</h2>
<p>9:24pm, Thursday, May 25, 2006</p>
<p>You know how we had the torrential downpour this morning? It stopped
after just about 2 hours and the sun came out. Yes, this caused it
to become super-hot and really muggy. The boys noticed and commented
on the high humidity. Everyone was a bit sweaty and sticky as we
walked around, and appreciative when the evening came around and
the temperature was a bit more moderate.</p>
<p>In the evening, some of the Brothers (Alex, Olaf, and Forrest) went
to swim and the rest went to play in the rec center. I went with
the swimmers and we had a grand time, estimating the size of the
pool to be on the order of 5 or 6 Piedmont Pools. When we found out
this was just the crummy outside pool and that the "real" competitive
pool was indoors we were doubly impressed. We swam in the deep end
and also dived off the 1 meter and 3 meter boards.</p>
<p>After a while, the pool was cleared on account of a thunderstorm
rolling into the area. We played a few games of "Drop 4" on a jumbo
set they had by the pool. Olaf beat everyone handily, me included.</p>
<p>We met back at the rooms and got everyone to sleep after some time.
Tomorrow, the instant challenge awaits!</p>
<h2>Special Report: correspondent Alexander</h2>
<p>12:20pm, Friday, May 26, 2006</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Scherman + Rest of class,</p>
<p>We're happy to tell you that we're moving along nicely on our
props/performance. Some of the earlier setbacks, such as taking
apart some of the props has proven to be good, because we went crazy
and made it totally (way) cool. We've also watched some of the other
challenges, including one of the high school ones for the challenge,
"Kidz Rulz". It was really really good, and I'd be surprised if
they didn't win. We also soaked ourselves to the bone with this
weird fountain thing. The funny thing is everyone loved it, even
though we all have blood shot eyes. The UT campus has two pools,
both the size of about six Piedmont Pools. It is even bigger than
an Olympic pool. They have a diving board that's 10 meters up.
That's 30 feet. I can't imagine what it would feel like to go off
for the first time, I went off the 9 foot one, and it was really
scary. The pool was 20 feet deep in the diving area, and in the
indoor pool, which was even bigger, it was 25 feet. It would kill
my ears pretty bad if I had to go down that deep. We had our instant
challenge. I'm prohibited from talking about it, but I'll tell you.
They really put us to the test in that one. However, out of the 100
points (max), 20 of them were for teamwork. We had extreme teamwork.
This is just a small example of how much they try and teach us
teamwork. Just like the saying, "Location Location Location", this
is "Teamwork, Teamwork, Teamwork". I love the appraisers here,
they're so nice. They make like "Super Hats", which they wear. This
one person made a chicken hat, and another woman, from our region
made a "Nacho Hat". It was so cool. Well, I hope things are going
well in the good ol' state of California.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Alex~</p>
<h2>Instant Challenges and Playing in the Fountain</h2>
<p>1:21pm, Friday, May 26, 2006</p>
<p>So we got up early and did some stuff for the 3M instant challenge,
which is to make something out of duct tape (invented by 3M, who
knew?). They did this out by the elevators where they worked on
their performance last night. Every few minutes, some of the girls
from a team in Texas would pop out of the elevator, with many giggles
ensuing. We chatted with them and made arrangements to go and see
their performance later in the day.</p>
<p>They went off to instant challenge, where they didn't do as well
as they hoped. However, they were pleased to have gotten full marks
(20 out of 20) on teamwork and cooperation. It did a pretty good
job on getting them focused on the performance competition tomorrow.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="153774578_9916034b30.jpg" /></p>
<p>They went to eat lunch (at our now-standard BBQ pavillion) and see
their new-found friends' performance. Following that we went to the
fountain where everyone was playing in the water. It was a welcome
relief from the heat, which was in the high 80's. We came back to
the dorm, where we discovered the niceness of a midday shower.</p>
<p>We've just done a walk-through, and are off to the rec center...
Dinner at 6:00, and then swimming again. When I get back I'll upload
some more pictures... [update: pictures uploaded!]</p>
<p>Editorial note: Of all the pictures I've taken of the Brothers
during the past two years, this one is my personal favorite. I'll
definitely post a high-resolution version when I get back.</p>
<h2>More Water Fun</h2>
<p>7:55pm, Friday, May 26, 2006</p>
<p><img alt="" src="153951405_b4b38b8a1c.jpg" /></p>
<p>The high today was 86 degrees, with a pretty high humidity thanks
to an early morning rainshower. One advantage of that is that the
pool is warm and perfect for evening swimming. After dinner we
cleaned up and went to the pool (did I mention homework in the
previous post? We did that in the afternoon, and the Brothers worked
diligently on their assignments.)</p>
<p><img alt="" src="153950995_484c7c5cdd.jpg" /></p>
<p>We spent quite a lot of time at the pool, not coming home till past
9:30. In addition to swimming and diving (a few of them off the
3-meter board, a sight to behold!), there was an enormous slip-and-slide
which was a lot of fun. There were two tracks next to each other,
so they could run in pairs and slide together. There were water
sprayers to keep everything wet and slippery, and a splash pool at
the end that served as a landing zone. The only drawback seemed to
be that all of this was fed from a hose, so it was a cold cold cold
splash at the end.</p>
<p>We came back, cleaned up and showered, and got right to bed. Everyone
was pretty tired out from the day's activities, and they know there's
a lot riding on tomorrow. They did a walk-through of the script
today, and it sounded pretty good. They're concerned about their
backdrop holding together throughout the backdrop flips, and might
make a few last minute fixes to that in order to keep it together.
Interestingly enough, they received some new stretchy plastic tape
from 3M yesterday that looks like it might be good for this.</p>
<p>So, tomorrow is the big day... keep the Brothers in your thoughts
and prayers!</p>
<p>administrivia: Blogspot has been fussy about image uploading, so
I've been typing in these reports and uploading the images to
flickr.com. I'll fiddle with it some more and get some pictures
uploaded.</p>
<p>Also, if you want to watch the closing ceremonies, check out the
details at the webcast page. Two things to note:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I think this is at 4:00pm your time on Saturday.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't miss this time, because it will be streamed "live" and if
you don't see it then, you won't get a chance to see it later.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There are also some photos at the global finals page. What they
don't mention is that anybody at the actual global finals can't
enjoy them very much because we're stuck with ridiculously slow
dialup connections! But you at home can enjoy them all. :-)</p>
<h2>These are not the jawbreakers I remember from my youth</h2>
<p>9:19pm, Friday, May 26, 2006</p>
<p><img alt="" src="153773906_043bbfe33e.jpg" /></p>
<p>As in, when I was a youth the jawbreakers could actually be placed
in between the jaws! However, this confection was the odds-on
favorite when they stopped to get candy, and nobody enjoyed it with
more gusto than Olaf.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="153774189_480f0198a7.jpg" /></p>
<p>These do seem to have a couple of natural advantages: you can't
actually get enough of them into your mouth to actually eat them,
and people on the bus are happy to give you plenty of room.</p>
<h2>News Flash... 8th place of 68 teams!</h2>
<p>10:01pm, Saturday, May 27, 2006</p>
<p><img alt="" src="154574397_5d2174ec5b.jpg" /></p>
<p>Yes, the Brothers pulled it together and their performance was
amazing. More later, but be prepared for good news!</p>
